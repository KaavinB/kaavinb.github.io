## Work Experience
**Research Intern @ VIT Chennai (_Nov 2023 - Dec 2023_)**  
Guide: Dr. Sudhakaran G
- Implemented scalable federated learning architecture using the Flower framework for distributed training.
- Developed a custom LSTM model in TensorFlow/Keras for time series forecasting in federated learning.
- Created a data preprocessing pipeline including feature engineering and outlier removal for large-scale time series data.
- Designed client-side training and evaluation logic for efficient model updates and performance assessment.
- Implemented server-side aggregation using weighted averaging for combining distributed client models.

## Projects
### Facial Recognition Attendance System
Developed a facial recognition system using **Python** and **OpenCV**. Led a team of 4 to integrate the model into an Android app for efficient attendance tracking, reducing the time from 10 minutes to 3 minutes.

### COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Rays
Utilized **CNN** and **TensorFlow** to build a detection system that classifies chest X-rays for COVID-19 with high accuracy, contributing to the open-source community.

### Real-time Spam Detection
Built a spam detection system using **NLP** and **Logistic Regression** with **TF-IDF** feature extraction, achieving 96.7% accuracy on training data and 96.5% on test data. Integrated the system with Gmail API for real-time email scanning.
